# CSRF
Cross-website request forgery (otherwise called CSRF) is a web security weakness that permits an attacker to incite clients to perform activities that they don't mean to perform. It permits an intruder to halfway evade a similar origin policy, which is intended to keep various sites from interfering with one another.
